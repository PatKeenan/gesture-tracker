# Hand Tracker

This project uses the tensorflow hand detection library to manipulate the square on the screen. Eventually, a user will be able to navigate the website using predetermined gestures.

### Running Locally

1. Install the dependencies: `yarn`
2. Start the development server: `yarn dev`
3. Temporary fix - press save in `App.tsx` to fix the issue with the tensorflow model not being fully loaded
